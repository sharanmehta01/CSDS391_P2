Explaining the neural network architecture


Preprocessing the data -  
We use tensorflow (integrated with keras) to set up our neural network. Our goal is to train the model on the full iris data set (3 species, 4 attributes). 

After importing the required packages, we read the CSV file using pandas and rename each of the speicies as floats (setosa = 0.0, versicolor = 1.0, virginica = 2.0) to avoid erros regaridng mixed data types.

We create two numpy arrays, one for the four different attriubtes/features over which the model needs to be trained and one for the labels (name of the speicies itself).

An important part of of preprocessing the data is normalizing the x-axis vaues. This transforms the range from 0 to
